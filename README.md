Linkify is currently a school management system for Lego Spike, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi equipment. This system allows users to send loan requests for the mentioned equipment to one or multiple users. It includes entering the box number, the delivery date, the user's account number, the user's email address, and the user's full name. The loans are recorded and displayed to the administrator, who can also terminate the loan at any time.
