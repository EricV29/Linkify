<h3 align="center">
Linkify is currently a school management system for Lego Spike, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi equipment. This system allows users to send loan requests for the mentioned equipment to one or multiple users. It includes entering the box number, the delivery date, the user's account number, the user's email address, and the user's full name. The loans are recorded and displayed to the administrator, who can also terminate the loan at any time.

<h2 align="center">Project Setup</h2>

### 📁 Clone Repository

<p>To use this project locally, it is necessary to execute the following commands in your favorite code editor's terminal.</p>

- `git clone https://github.com/EricV29/Linkify.git`

### ⚙️ Configure Database with MySQL

Inside the `database/` folder, you will find the **`init_db.sql`** script.  
This script will **create the database, tables, and insert some sample data** required for the application to run correctly.

📁 `database/`  
&nbsp;&nbsp; └─ `init_db.sql`

💡 I configured the database using **Docker**, but you can also install **MySQL** locally on your computer if you prefer.

👤 The database already includes some **default users**.  
If you need to **modify** them or **add new ones**, you must do it directly from the database.

### 📄 Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

### ⚙️ Configure `.env`

You need to create a `.env` file based on the example `.envExample`, with the following variables:

- **PORTEMAIL** → Port assigned for sending emails.

- **USEREMAIL** → System administrator email address.

- **TOKENEMAIL** → App Password generated from Google:

  1. Go to your **Google Account → Security**
  2. Activate 2-Steps Verification.
  3. Serch **App Passwords**, create and copy **16-character key** → this is your `TOKENEMAIL`.

- **ADDRESSEMAIL** → System administrator email address.

- **ADDRESSEMAILLIBRARY** → Email address of the library administrator (**Role 3**).

### </> Development

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### 🚧 Build

```bash
# For windows
$ npm run build:win

# For macOS
$ npm run build:mac

# For Linux
$ npm run build:linux
```
